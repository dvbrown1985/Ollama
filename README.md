**Chatbot Overview**

**Large Language Model (LLM):** Utilizes the Ollama Mistral model, a powerful large language model for generating conversational text.

**User Interface:** Text-based interaction through standard input/output of the command line.

**User Experience:**

  - Welcomes the user and explains the interaction flow.
  - Prompts for user questions.
  - Sends user questions to the Ollama API for processing.
  - Presents the LLM's generated response to the user.
  - Asks if the user has further questions, creating a conversational loop.
  - Exits the loop at the userâ€™s request. 
  - Error Handling: Ensures user input for continuing the conversation is strictly "yes" or "no".

**Functions:**

  - **get_response(user_input):** Sends user input to Ollama API and streams the LLM's response.
  - **main():** Handles user interaction, prompting, and loop control.


**Execution:** The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.


**Benefits:**

  - Leverages Ollama's LLM capabilities for informative and potentially creative responses.

  - Simple and user-friendly text-based interface.

**Limitations:**

  - Relies on internet access for Ollama API communication.

  - LLM responses may not always be perfectly accurate or relevant.
